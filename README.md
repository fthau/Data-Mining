# Data-Mining

Developed a complete data mining pipeline in Python, processing a raw retail sales dataset using Pandas for data cleaning, imputation, and standardization.     

Engineered and selected predictive features using Scikit-learn, applying transformations like Z-score normalization, equal-frequency binning, and variance thresholding. 

Implemented and compared classification & multiple regression models (Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest) in Scikit-learn to predict online shopper engagement (PageValues).   

Tuned a Decision Tree's max_depth hyperparameter to optimize performance and analyzed feature importances to identify key business drivers.    

Evaluated model reliability using K-Fold Cross-Validation and hold-out splits, quantifying performance with MAE, MSE, RMSE, and R² metrics to analyze model fit and error.
